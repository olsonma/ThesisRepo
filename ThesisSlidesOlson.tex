% I'm going to be talking a lot about phase two trials - and in particular two stage phase II trials - 
% and what happens when we deviate from our plans, so I'm first going to start with an 
% introduction to two stage phase II trials to kind of orient ourselves and then we will go into the problem that we are interested in:
% which is what happens when we deviate from these planned phase II trials. We will look into the motivation and why we should care
% when we deviate. Then we will go into details about methods for handling deviations from planned sample sizes in second stage, and then deviations in the first stage
% And my thesis focuses more on the latter - first stage deviations - and it will become clear in my talk why that is. Then we will walk through an 
% example for deviation in the first stage to orient ourselves again and make things a little more concrete. Then we will talk about results of some investigation
% of these methods and then discuss them.

             \item Minimax minimizes the maximum sample size 
          \end{itemize}
        \item Jung \textit{et al.} introduced Admissible designs
            \begin{itemize}
              \item Compromise between Optimal and Minimax
              \item Similar maximum sample sizes as Minimax
              \item Similar expected sample size under $H_0$ as Optimal
            \end{itemize}
        \item Suppose $H_0: p_0 \leq 0.25$, $H_1: p_1 > 0.4$, $\alpha = 0.05$, $\beta = 0.2$

          \begin{itemize}
            \item Unanticipated recruitment speed
            \item Unanticipated drop out rates
            \item Delay in communication for multi-center trials
            \item Ethical considerations
            \item Shopping for sponsors
          \end{itemize}
        \item Nice properties go out the window
        \item Currently, common practice is to treat attained sample size as planned
        \item Leads to invalid inference
        \item Hypothesis testing is not straightforward

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Goal is to make a decision
        \item How do we do this if our attained sample size is different than planned?
        \item P-value calculations are complicated - we don't consider these solutions
        \item Consider prespecified ``redesigns" - recalculating critical values
        \item Primary focus on deviation in first stage
        %% so there's a lot of literature about what to do if deviation in second stage

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Over-enrollment in first stage: perform interim analysis on the planned number of first stage, adjust testing procedure for attained second stage %% this is the straightforward solution and this is what we use here
        \item Under-enrollment: just wait
        \item Literature exists for point estimation, calculation of p-values when stage II differs (Review: Porcher \textit{et al.})
        \item P-values in two-stage trials depend on planned design and attained data, complicated when attained SS differ than planned [Koyama and Chen] % so, because of this, we don't focus on calculating p-values, but rather redesigns. Koyama and Chen first propose the redesign

The extremeness of an obsevation is measured, not by the magnitude of the LR, but by the probability of observing a likelihood ratio that large or larger. It's the tail area, not the likelihood ratio, that is meaningful quantity in hypothesis testing," Blume, 2002
